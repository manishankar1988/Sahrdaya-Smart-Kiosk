Institution Overview
Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology,
Kodakara
Established by the Diocese of Irinjalakuda, Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology
was founded with the vision of imparting value-based, quality technical education that
integrates professional competence with ethical responsibility. The institution is managed by
the Irinjalakuda Diocesan Educational Trust, registered in 2001, under the visionary leadership
of His Excellency Mar James Pazhayattil, the first Bishop of the Diocese.
The college was established in 2002 with approval from the All India Council for Technical
Education (AICTE) and was initially affiliated to the University of Calicut. Located on a
picturesque 25-acre green campus at Kodakara, Thrissur District, the institution provides a
serene and intellectually stimulating environment conducive to academic excellence,
innovation, and holistic development.
In alignment with the restructuring of technical education in the State, the institution
transitioned in 2015 to affiliation with APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University
(APJAKTU), Kerala. Over the years, Sahrdaya has expanded its academic portfolio to offer six
undergraduate (B.Tech) programmes:
 Biomedical Engineering
 Biotechnology Engineering
 Civil Engineering
 Computer Science and Engineering
 Electronics and Communication Engineering
 Electrical and Electronics Engineering
The institution also offers four postgraduate (M.Tech) programmes:
 Biomedical Engineering
 Computer Science and Engineering
 Industrial Biotechnology
 Embedded Systems
In addition to undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, the institution offers PhD research
programmes in approved disciplines, fostering a strong research culture and enabling scholars
to pursue advanced studies aligned with contemporary technological and societal needs. The
college also offers Postgraduate Diploma programmes in emerging and interdisciplinary areas,
aimed at enhancing professional competencies, upskilling graduates, and supporting lifelong
learning in response to evolving industry and research demands.
In recognition of its academic maturity and governance practices, Academic Autonomy was
conferred by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2024. This milestone empowered
the institution to implement Outcome-Based Education (OBE), the Choice-Based Credit
System (CBCS), and flexible, industry-aligned curricula, promoting interdisciplinary learning,
innovation, and skill development.
Sahrdaya is NAAC-accredited, and all undergraduate engineering programmes are NBA
accredited by 2025, reflecting sustained adherence to national quality benchmarks. The
institution is well regarded among engineering colleges in Kerala for its disciplined academic
environment, consistent student outcomes, and strong value system.
The college provides state-of-the-art laboratories, ICT-enabled classrooms, a fully digitized
central library, a language laboratory, modern computing facilities, well-maintained hostels,
transport services, and comprehensive sports and fitness infrastructure. The lush green campus
and eco-friendly initiatives contribute to a vibrant and enriching campus life.
